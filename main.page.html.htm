 This is the main page for operating system feed An operating system  (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software  resources, and provides common services for computer programs.

 Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the  system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of  processor time, mass storage, printing, and other resources.
 
 For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation,  the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the  computer hardware,[1][2] although the application code is usually  executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to  an OS function or is interrupted by it. Operating systems are found on  many devices that contain a computer – from cellular phones and video  game consoles to web servers and supercomputers.
